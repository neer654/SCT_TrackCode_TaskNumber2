Titanic Survival Analysis

Project Overview :-  
This project analyzes the famous Titanic dataset to uncover patterns and relationships that influenced passenger survival during the tragic sinking of the RMS Titanic. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and correlation analysis, we explore key features such as passenger class, fare, age, and family relationships to understand their impact on survival rates.  
The goal is to gain insights into the factors affecting survival and lay the foundation for building predictive models.

Dataset Description :-  
The Titanic dataset contains information about the passengers onboard the Titanic, including:-
1) PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger
2) Survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
3) Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
4) Name, Sex, Age: Passenger details
5) SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
6) Parch: Number of parents/children aboard
7) Ticket, Fare: Ticket number and fare paid
8) Cabin, Embarked: Cabin number and port of embarkation

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):-  
The dataset was preprocessed and analyzed to understand the distribution and relationships between variables. Visualizations include distribution plots and correlation heatmaps, highlighting key relationships among numerical features.

Conclusion:-  
This analysis reveals that socioeconomic factors like ticket class and fare were significant determinants of survival on the Titanic. Family relationships aboard also show some patterns but were less directly tied to survival. These insights form a valuable foundation for developing predictive models to classify passenger survival based on available features.
